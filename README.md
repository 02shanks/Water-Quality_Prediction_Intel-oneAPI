## Tech Stack Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - [Any other libraries or frameworks used]

## Feature Selection and Imputation

Describe the techniques and methods used for feature selection and imputation of missing data in your dataset. This could include methods like:

- Recursive Feature Elimination
- Imputation with mean, median, or custom strategies
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction

## Synthetic Data Generation

If you used synthetic data to augment your dataset, explain the approach you took. This might include:

- Generating synthetic data using libraries like `imbalanced-learn` or `faker`.
- Using data augmentation techniques for image data.
- Creating synthetic data to address class imbalance.

## Various Models Used

List and briefly describe the various machine learning models you experimented with. For example:

- Random Forest
  - Parameters used: [list of hyperparameters]
- Support Vector Machine
  - Parameters used: [list of hyperparameters]
- Neural Network
  - Architecture: [brief description]
  
## Final Technique: Stacking

Explain the final technique used, such as model stacking, ensemble methods, or any other advanced techniques. Provide details on how these models were combined and why this approach was chosen.

## Final Results

Share the key results and metrics obtained from your models. This could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or any domain-specific metrics. You can also include visualizations like confusion matrices or ROC curves to illustrate your results.

## References

List any references, research papers, or libraries you used in your project. Properly cite any external sources to give credit to the authors and maintain good academic practice.
